=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::AutoRoutePm - Mojolicious plugin to create routes by *.pm modules which are a controller

=head1 USAGE

This module recursive passes through template_base_dir to find perl module
(*.pm) that are a subclass of Mojolicious::Controller and some paths;

For module X::Y::Z it adds the decamelize version

  x/y/z
  x/y/z/index
  x/y/z/index/*query

all redirect to action route inside module.

If Z is default_index it adds also

  x/y
  x/y/*query

The last structure is useful for routing seach. But be careful to correct
relative urls of other items in html page.

This can be done in many ways. One is, as an example, to add to the layout
a base_url like this

  % my $base_url = url_for(undef, {query => undef}); $base_url =~ s|/$||;
  <base href="<%= $base_url %>" />

=head2 register

  plugin->register($app);
